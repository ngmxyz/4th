# ðŸ‘‹ Howdy!

I research early-stage technologies that are working on the defense industrial base. 

This GitHub repository is for a project of mine called The 4th List. Every week, I send out a list of the companies I come across to investors. That list includes the names of the companies, a one sentence description of what they are building, and a one sentence description of any publicly available fundraising information (i.e. "they raised a $xM Seed from this investor and this investor in Q2 of 2023").

Yes, building this from scratch in GitHub was totally unnecessary. I felt like it would be a bit more fun to learn to code this way though :)

Some sub-project ideas I want to build for this and their statuses:
* Subscriber website: MVP live (https://ngmxyz.github.io/4th/) 1.6.24
* Internal database for keeping track of all the companies and subscribers: Transitioned to MVP 1.7.24
* Scraping investor websites & social media interactions for new companies: eventually
* Subscriber-facing filterable database of featured companies: eventually
* Subscriber-facing learning resources (reading lists, exercises, etc.): eventually
