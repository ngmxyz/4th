# ðŸ‘‹ Howdy!

I research early-stage technologies that are working on the defense industrial base. 

This GitHub repository is for a project of mine called The 4th List. I felt like an interesting project would be to try and get as many of these companies as I could in front of investors that care, so automating a distribution list seemed easy and worthwhile.

This isn't a newsletter, since there isn't any commentary or news... it is literally just a list of a few companies, a one sentence description of what they build, and a one sentence overview of any publicly available information about their funding.
