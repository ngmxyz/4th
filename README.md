# ðŸ‘‹ Howdy!

I research early-stage technologies that are working on our industrial base. 

This GitHub repository is for a project of mine called The 4th List. About every other week, I send out a list of the companies I come across to investors. That list includes the names of the companies, a one sentence description of what they are building, and a one sentence description of any publicly available fundraising information (i.e. "they raised a $xM Seed from this investor and this investor in Q2 of 2023").

Each issue takes about 45 seconds to read.
